## Introduction

A weather app designed to bring the up to date **weather** to the user. The user can search the location they want and recieved the current **weather** conditions for that location instantly. **WeatherLens** is designed to respond to the users inputs and display the **weather** information they are seeking. 

## UX
---

### User Stories

*Generic User*

* As a user, I want to be able to **search** for a location.

* As a user, I want to be able to **identify** the weather in my chosen location.

*  As a user, I want to be able to **access numerous locations** on my visit to WeatherLens.

* As a user, I want to be able to see the **temperature** in my chosen location.


### Design 
1. **Logo**
The logo was created using [Free Logo Maker](https://logomakr.com) and was designed to incorporate the **weather** and the **lens** that allows you to view the weather in a chosen location.

2. **Colour Scheme**

The colours for the website were chosen using [Coolor](https://coolors.co/3c1642-086375-1dd3b0-fffdfd-ffffff) and aim to represent the different weathers. The chosen colours are:

* ![#656565](https://placehold.it/15/656565/000000?text=+) `#656565` - Dim Grey
* ![#89BBFE](https://placehold.it/15/89BBFE/000000?text=+) `#89BBFE` - French Sky Blue 
* ![#FFC857](https://placehold.it/15/FFC857/000000?text=+) `#FFC857` - Maximum Yellow Red

3. **Fonts**

The website has the main font of Arvo, which was chosen due to it **readability for all users**. It was chosen using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Arvo&display=swap) and has a default of Sans Serif.

4. **Wireframes**

The following wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=CjwKCAjwltH3BRB6EiwAhj0IUBrAHe-2BiRjQmQGSO-FZIjoEjkckL_kVyJXd5ShGVwKqDaDMqKjvBoCQksQAvD_BwE)

* The **weather conditions** of the location that the user has chosen to search.


### Features Left to Implement
